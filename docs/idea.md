## **Forge IDE - Visual Software Architecture & Modules-Driven and LLM Task Programming Development Platform**

### Core Vision
A revolutionary IDE that visualizes software as an interconnected graph of intelligent modules, where developers architect systems through high-level specifications and task definitions rather than writing code directly. The LLM backend translates architectural intent into functioning code while maintaining perfect awareness of inter-module relationships and data flows.

### Current Implementation
The current implementation of Forge includes:

1. **Block-Based Architecture**
   - Software modules represented as blocks with inputs, outputs, and connections
   - JSON-based configuration for storing block definitions
   - Dynamic loading and management of block configurations

2. **Visual Interface**
   - Card-based view for detailed block information
   - Interactive flow diagram for visualizing block connections
   - Ability to edit block descriptions and manage todo items

3. **Backend API**
   - RESTful API for CRUD operations on blocks
   - Support for adding and removing todo items
   - Sample configuration generation

### Future Development
Planned enhancements for the Forge IDE include:

1. **LLM Integration**
   - Natural language processing for task definitions
   - Automatic code generation based on block specifications
   - Intelligent suggestions for block connections and configurations

2. **Enhanced Visualization**
   - Real-time collaboration on block diagrams
   - Advanced layout algorithms for complex graphs
   - Custom block templates and themes

3. **Code Generation**
   - Translation of block diagrams into executable code
   - Support for multiple programming languages and frameworks
   - Continuous integration with version control systems

4. **Extensibility**
   - Plugin system for custom block types
   - Integration with external tools and services
   - API for third-party extensions
