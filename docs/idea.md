## **Forge IDE - Visual Software Architecture & Modules-Driven and LLM Task Programming Development Platform**

### Core Vision

A revolutionary IDE that visualizes software as an interconnected graph of intelligent modules, where developers architect systems through high-level specifications and task definitions rather than writing code directly. The LLM backend
translates architectural intent into functioning code while maintaining perfect awareness of inter-module relationships and data flows.

### Current Implementation

The current implementation of Forge includes:

1. **Block-Based Architecture**
    - Software modules represented as blocks with inputs, outputs, and connections
    - JSON-based configuration for storing block definitions
    - Dynamic loading and management of block configurations

2. **Visual Interface**
    - Card-based view for detailed block information
    - Interactive flow diagram for visualizing block connections
    - Ability to edit block descriptions and manage todo items

3. **Backend API**
    - RESTful API for CRUD operations on blocks
    - Support for adding and removing todo items
    - Sample configuration generation

4. **LLM Integration**
    - Multiple LLM providers supported (OpenRouter, Gemini, Anthropic)
    - Auto-completion and enhancement of block descriptions
    - Automatic task generation from block descriptions
    - Processing markdown specifications to generate blocks

5. **Git Integration**
    - Branch creation and management
    - Commit, merge, push, and pull operations
    - Task execution with Git integration
    - Diff viewing for tasks
    - Build handling

6. **Task Management**
    - Task execution functionality
    - Task status tracking
    - Task logs and commit tracking

### Future Development

Planned enhancements for the Forge IDE include:

1. **Advanced LLM Capabilities**
    - More sophisticated code generation based on block specifications
    - Intelligent suggestions for block connections and configurations
    - Automated refactoring and code optimization

2. **Enhanced Visualization**
    - Real-time collaboration on block diagrams
    - Advanced layout algorithms for complex graphs
    - Custom block templates and themes

3. **Expanded Code Generation**
    - Support for multiple programming languages and frameworks
    - More comprehensive code generation from block diagrams
    - Automated test generation

4. **Extensibility**
    - Plugin system for custom block types
    - Integration with external tools and services
    - API for third-party extensions
