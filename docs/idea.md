## **Forge IDE - Visual Software Architecture & Modules-Driven and LLM Task programing Development Platform **

### Refined Core Vision:
A revolutionary IDE that visualizes software as an interconnected graph of intelligent modules, where developers architect systems through high-level specifications and task definitions rather than writing code directly. The LLM backend translates architectural intent into functioning code while maintaining perfect awareness of inter-module relationships and data flows.
