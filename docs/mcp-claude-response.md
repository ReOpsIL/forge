⏺ MCP Server Design for Forge-Claude Code Integration

Based on my analysis, here's a comprehensive MCP server design that would
significantly enhance the integration between Forge and Claude Code:

Current State Analysis

Forge Architecture:

- Visual block-based development platform with task management
- Rust backend with Actix-web serving React frontend
- Git integration with automated task execution using Claude CLI
- Basic Claude API integration for chat functionality
- Task execution pipeline: task → branch → Claude CLI → commit → merge

Existing Limitations:

- Claude CLI is invoked as external process without context sharing
- No bidirectional communication during task execution
- Limited access to Forge's internal state and project knowledge
- Basic HTTP API for Claude chat, not utilizing MCP protocol

Proposed MCP Server Design

- forge_check_code_quality: Run linting and quality checks with context

Advanced Features

6. Intelligent Code Generation

- forge_generate_code_template: Generate code templates based on block specifications
- forge_suggest_refactoring: Analyze and suggest refactoring opportunities
- forge_generate_documentation: Auto-generate documentation from block descriptions

7. Real-time Collaboration

- forge_stream_task_progress: Stream real-time task execution updates
- forge_get_active_sessions: Get information about active development sessions
- forge_share_context: Share context between multiple Claude instances

8. Performance & Monitoring

- forge_get_performance_metrics: Get development and runtime performance data
- forge_analyze_bottlenecks: Identify performance bottlenecks in block architecture
- forge_suggest_optimizations: Recommend performance improvements

Implementation Recommendations

Phase 1: Core Integration (Weeks 1-2)

1. Replace HTTP API with MCP Protocol
    - Implement proper MCP server in src/mcp_server.rs
    - Add MCP tools for basic project and block operations
    - Integrate with existing TaskExecutor for seamless task management
2. Enhanced Task Context
    - Extend Task model to include richer context (related files, dependencies, etc.)
    - Implement context-aware task generation and execution
    - Add support for multi-step task workflows

Phase 2: Advanced Features (Weeks 3-4)

1. Intelligent Code Generation
    - Implement code template generation based on block types
    - Add support for multiple programming languages
    - Integrate with existing LLM providers for enhanced code suggestions
2. Real-time Communication
    - Implement WebSocket-based MCP server for real-time updates
    - Add support for streaming task execution progress
    - Enable bidirectional communication during task execution

Phase 3: Collaboration & Quality (Weeks 5-6)

1. Multi-session Support
    - Enable multiple Claude instances to work on the same project
    - Implement session management and context sharing
    - Add conflict resolution for concurrent modifications
2. Quality Assurance Integration
    - Integrate with testing frameworks and CI/CD pipelines
    - Add automated code review and quality checks
    - Implement performance monitoring and optimization suggestions

Key Benefits

1. Enhanced Productivity: Claude Code gets full context about project structure,
   dependencies, and ongoing work
2. Intelligent Task Management: Automatic task dependency resolution and
   context-aware execution
3. Seamless Git Integration: Smart branching, committing, and merging based on block
   architecture
4. Real-time Collaboration: Multiple developers and AI assistants working together
   seamlessly
5. Quality Assurance: Automated testing, code review, and performance optimization
6. Learning & Adaptation: MCP server learns from project patterns and improves
   suggestions over time

⏺ Update Todos
⎿ ☒ Analyze Forge project structure and architecture                 
☒ Review existing MCP server implementation if any
☒ Design MCP server functionality for Forge-Claude Code integration
☒ Provide implementation recommendations

⏺ This MCP server design would transform Forge from a basic visual development platform
into a sophisticated AI-powered development environment where Claude Code has deep
understanding of your project architecture, can intelligently execute complex tasks,
and collaborate effectively with human developers. The integration would leverage
Forge's existing strengths while adding powerful new capabilities for modern software
development workflows.
